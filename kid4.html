            Originating in France, this is the story of Belle, a beautiful peasant girl who 
            took the place of her father, when he was taken prisoner by a fierce beast.<br>
While things were uncomfortable and frightening for Belle at first, she soon grew fond of the beast,
 as he had done nothing but treat her with kindness. When Belle found out her father was sick, she begged
  the beast to let her go to him and promised to return, but she was held up by the evil Gaston, a famous 
  hunter from the village who wanted to marry Belle. When the village found out about the beast, they vowed
   to kill him and stormed his castle. Though he nearly died, he was saved and turned into a handsome prince
    because of Belle’s love for him. It turns out that he had been a prince who, along with his entire household,
     was cursed by a witch because he did not treat her with kindness. Belle and the Prince marry, and live a happy
      and peaceful life together.<br><br>
From the prince’s curse, children can learn about the importance of being kind and that if they do not,
 they will suffer bad consequences. From Belle, we learn to value what is in a person’s heart, rather than
  their outward appearance.
