            There was once a king who had beautiful daughters. The youngest often liked to play with
             a golden ball near a pond, in the middle of a forest near the palace. One day, her ball
              fell into the pond, and it was much too deep for the princess to get, but she was given
               help by a kind frog who told her that her tears would even melt the stones. He told her
                that he would get her ball for her, if she allowed him to be her playmate and eat from her
                 plate, drink from her cup and stay with her. She agreed, but she did not keep her word when
                  the frog returned her ball to her. Instead, she ran home and left him behind.<br><br>
            The next morning the frog showed up at her home, and he asked that she, please keep her end of
             the bargain. The king, upon hearing what happened, ordered his beloved daughter to keep her
              promise. So, she was forced to allow the frog to eat from her plate, drink from her cup and
               stay with her.<br>
            The morning after, the frog told the princess that he would leave her forever if she did one 
            last thing for him, which was to give him a kiss. She, being glad to be rid of him, agreed and 
            kissed him immediately. At once, the frog turned into a handsome young prince. He had been cursed,
             and the only thing that could break the curse was the kiss of a princess.<br><br>          
            Another lesson in not judging anyone by their appearance, this story also has the added benefit of
             teaching your children that it benefits to keep your promises.
