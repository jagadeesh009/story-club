            The US women's national soccer team's quest for the 2019 FIFA World Cup began on June 11, 2019,
             with a resounding 13-0 win over Thailand. In addition to being the largest margin of victory ever
              in a women’s World Cup match, the score also set a new record for the most goals in a single World 
              Cup game — for both men and women. The team's incredible journey ended almost a month later on July 7,
               2019, with a thrilling 2-0 victory against the Netherlands.
                <br><br>
            Team USA's second consecutive World Cup win, which puts it on par with Germany, which won the tournament 
            in 2003 and 2007, did not come easily. The Netherlands soccer team, which before this had only played in 
            one World Cup, proved to be a formidable opponent, defending the ball fiercely. On the rare occasions that
             the American players managed to create scoring opportunities, they were stopped by Dutch goalkeeper Sari 
             van Veenendaal. Unlike the previous five matches, when the US managed to sneak in a goal or two within the 
             first quarter, the game remained scoreless at the half
            The Americans finally got the break they had been seeking in the 61st minute, when US co-captain Alex Morgan
             was fouled in the penalty box by Dutch defender Stefanie van der Gragt. ​​​ Fellow co-captain Megan Rapinoe 
             took full advantage of this unexpected opportunity and scored a seemingly effortless goal. Rapinoe's third 
             converted penalty and sixth tournament goal earned the 34-year-old forward both the Golden Ball 
             (Most Valuable Player) and the Golden Boot (tournament's top scorer) trophies.<br><br>

            Team USA's second and the game's final goal, came shortly after, in the 69th minute, when 24-year-old
             midfielder Rose Lavelle, playing in her first major tournament, landed the ball into the net from
              a distance of about 18 yards. “Over the course of the game, it was hard to find that kind of space,”
               Lavelle later said. “Finally, there was an opportunity to take space. I decided to go for it. … 
               I like my left foot, man, and I got it on my left foot.”
