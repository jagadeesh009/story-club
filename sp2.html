          <p>
            US gymnast Simone Biles, who has dominated the sport since the 2013 World Championships, 
            is often described as “the greatest gymnast of all time” and “superhuman.” The 21-year-old
             phenom proved herself worthy of both labels at the recently held World Championships in Doha, 
             Qatar when she won a medal in every discipline, including four golds, while battling a painful 
             kidney stone.<br><br>

            Biles was rushed to hospital on the eve of her first event on October 26, after experiencing dull
             pain on the right side of her abdomen. The good news was the discomfort was the result of a kidney
              stone, not appendicitis, which would have required immediate surgery. The bad news? It was too big
               to pass and had to be surgically extracted. But since the procedure was not urgent, the spunky athlete
                decided not to let what she nicknamed “The Doha Pearl” get in the way of helping the USA make more 
                gymnastics history. She tweeted to her worried fans, “this kidney stone can wait . . . doing it for 
                my team . . . I’ll be gucci girls.”<br><br>
                True to her word, the following day Biles posted the highest individual scores on the beam, vault,
                 and floor, and was second on uneven bars through five of 11 qualifying groups. Her most impressive 
                 performance came on the vault when she became the first female gymnast to complete what will now be 
                 called “The Biles” – a complicated routine involving a roundoff, half-twist onto the structure,
                  followed by a front double full off.<br><br>

            All in all, Biles took home six medals – golds in the team final, the all-around, floor, and the vault,
             bronze on beam, and silver on uneven bars, traditionally her weakest routine. In addition to being the 
             first American, male or female, to medal in every event, she is also the first woman of any nationality 
             to do so since Romania’s Daniela Silivas achieved the feat at the 1988 Olympics. Additionally, the fantastic
              gymnast now holds the most all-around golds (4) in World Championship history, and her overall win of 20 
              medals matches the record held by Russia’s Svetlana Khokrina. Biles is most likely also the first athlete 
              to accomplish the feats while battling a painful kidney stone, for which she took minimal medication for 
              fear of failing the strict drug tests.
