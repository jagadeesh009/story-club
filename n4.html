            With schools and businesses closed and many cities and towns under mandatory shelter-in-place orders, the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has drastically changed lives globally within a matter of weeks. To bring joy, optimism, and strength during this difficult period, people and organizations worldwide are performing random acts of kindness for total strangers. Here are a few heartwarming deeds that will bring a smile to your face during these unprecedented times.
<br><br>
        <b>Paying it forward</b><br>
The ban on in-person dining, imposed across many states to slow down the spread of COVD-19, is hitting the US restaurant industry hard, leaving many on the brink of shutting down. Now, some loyal customers are stepping up to help their favorite eateries. On March 18, 2020, a regular patron at Irma's Southwest, a Tex-Mex restaurant in Houston, Texas, stunned workers by leaving a $9,400 tip, with a note saying, "Hold tip to pay your guys over the next few weeks." Owner Louis Galvan, told Foxnews, "It was a regular — a regular of the restaurant for about 15 years. He came in and had a modest dinner of shrimp tacos and then left a $9,400 gratuity."
<br><br>
Coaches Bar and Grill in Columbus, Ohio, experienced similar generosity from a patron who added a hefty $2,500 tip to his modest $29.75 tab, to be split among the restaurant's workers.
<br><br>        
Chefs and restaurant owners across the country are also finding creative ways to help their staff, while also contributing to their communities. San Francisco, California's popular Che Fico is putting together ready-to-go meals with a retail value of $50 that can be bought or picked up for free by those in need. Anyone purchasing a meal is encouraged to donate $50 towards a free meal for a family in need. Many restaurants in Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, are giving away free food to anyone in need via donations, while others are adding rolls of toilet paper, which are in short-supply, to delivery orders!
<br><br>
World Central Kitchen, a non-profit spearheaded by Spanish-American chef José Andrés to provide meals during natural disasters, is working with partners to safely distribute individually-packaged fresh meals to communities in need in Los Angeles and Oakland, California, Washington, DC, and Little Rock, Arkansas.
