          <p>
            During the summer of 1983, in a quiet town near Minneapolis, Minnesota, the charred body of
             a woman was found inside the kitchen stove of a small farmhouse. A video camera was also found
              in the kitchen, standing on a tripod, pointing at the oven. No tape was found inside the camera
               at the time.<br>
            Although the scene was originally labeled as a homicide by police, an unmarked VHS tape was later 
            discovered at the bottom of the farm’s well, which had apparently dried up earlier that year.<br>
            Despite its worn condition, and the fact that it contained no audio, police were still able to 
            view the contents of the tape. It depicted a woman recording herself in front of a video camera,
             seemingly using the same camera that the police found in the kitchen. After positioning the camera
              to include both her and her kitchen stove in its view, she turned on the oven, opened the door,
               crawled inside, and then closed the door behind her. After eight minutes into the video, the
                oven could be seen shaking violently. At this point thick, black smoke emanated from it. For
                 the remaining 45 minutes of video, until the batteries in the camera died, it remained in its
                  stationary position.<br><br>
            To avoid disturbing the local community, the police never released any information about the tape,
             or even the fact that it was found. Police were also not able to determine who put the tape in the 
             well, or why the height and stature of the woman in the video did not come close to matching the body
              that they had found in the oven
